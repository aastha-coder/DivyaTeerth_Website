# DivyaTeerth_Website
DivyaTeerth is a pilgrimage tourism platform designed to offer customized itineraries for spiritual destinations like Haridwar, the Ganges, and the Char Dham Yatra. Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript aims to simplify planning for meaningful and culturally rich journeys. It offers different travel packages like Budget, Standard, and Premium for popular places such as Haridwar, Rishikesh, Varanasi, and Char Dham. The website helps users plan their trip by showing ready-made itineraries and package details. One useful feature of DivyaTeerth is the RPIEC calculator, which stands for Revenue Per Individual Estimated Cost. It calculates the cost per person by dividing the total package price by the number of people. For example, if a package costs ₹60,000 and 4 people are traveling, the RPIEC will be ₹15,000 per person. This helps users understand how much each person needs to pay. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React) and is mobile-friendly. In the future, features like online payments, user logins, and reviews can be added. DivyaTeerth aims to make spiritual travel easier, more affordable, and well-organized for everyone.
